# Punk-Cities
Collaborative play-to-earn game based on metadata from places in cities

Players will play as Solarpunks or Cyberpunks and choose a hometown where they will be rewarded with Energy or Chips, by registering and verifying parks, landmarks, universities, bike trails, industrial zones, and other elements from their hometowns as NFTs. These rewards can be used to upgrade their hometown places, increase their rewards for all verifiers, and mark the place for the team with the most verifications.
 
Beyond the difference between Solarpunks and Cyberpunks, the game incentivizes collaboration between teams to maximize the rewards for all the players in a city.
